my_shell is the complete project1 and the   XXXXXXXXXX{SYSTEM} are the important parts of it 

1. the first is print like this : srx@ubuntu:home/haizei   with color  {SYSTEM}
                                 username@hostname:dir   
2. the second is to list the common outcome formats   such as color size of the font  {SYSTEM}

3. the third is a C example of realizing the command cd  {SYSTEM}

4. the forth is try to banish ctrl+z    {SYSTEM}

5. this one is a model of prime sieve    {C Algorithm}

6. this one is a model of binary_search   {C Algorithm}
[narrow the range and then you will learn that the final result is the binary_search]

7. this one is the system commond ll {SYSTEM}

8. this one is the a function that adjusts the console size  {SYSTEM}

9. the cmd of cp

10. judgment the leap years {C example}

11. factorial {C example}

shell4.sh this is the shell program to record the sum days of the year

shell5.sh this is the shell program of a clock lv1

shell6.sh practice of array

shell7.sh practice of prime_drying

shell8.sh practice of line_drying

shell9.sh use this program can split the text or directory and echo the longest three strings lv1

shell10.sh this is the shell program of a clock lv2
